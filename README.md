# 9Router ProxyPool

Self-hosted proxy pools for [9Router](https://github.com/decolua/9router) — route OpenCode Free traffic through your own proxy with auto-recovery.

## Two Proxy Options

| Option | What it does | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **[Cloudflare WARP](./docs/cloudflare-warp.md)** ⭐ | SOCKS5 proxy with **IP rotation** — routes through Cloudflare's network with multiple rotating IPs | Hiding your real server IP + distribute traffic across IPs |
| **[Squid Proxy](./docs/squid-proxy.md)** | Anonymous HTTP proxy that strips identifying headers (`Via`, `XFF`, etc.) + auth | Anonymity without IP change |

> **New here?** Start with [Cloudflare WARP](./docs/cloudflare-warp.md) — it's the recommended option for most users.

## ⚠️ For Educational & Research Purposes

This project is intended for **educational and research use only**:
- Respect the terms of service of any upstream provider you route through
- Do not use to circumvent authentication, billing, or access controls
- You are solely responsible for how you deploy and operate this software

The authors and contributors assume no liability for misuse.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** + **Docker Compose** ([install guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **9Router** already running (default: `http://10.0.0.1:20128/dashboard`)
- **OpenCode Free** provider visible in your 9Router dashboard

---

## Architecture

```
Your AI Tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
    ↓ sends request to 9Router
9Router (:20128)
    ↓ looks up OpenCode Free → sees proxy binding
Proxy Docker Container (WARP :10800 / Squid :3128)
    ↓ forwards traffic
opencode.ai
```

## Built On

- [ErcinDedeoglu/cloudflare-warp](https://github.com/ErcinDedeoglu/cloudflare-warp) — Cloudflare WARP client in Docker with multi-instance IP rotation
- [yegor256/squid-proxy](https://github.com/yegor256/squid-proxy) — anonymous Squid + HTTP Basic auth
- [decolua/9router](https://github.com/decolua/9router) — the AI gateway this proxy integrates with

---

## Contributing

Contributions welcome — fork, open issues, submit PRs.

**Areas we'd love help with:**
- Cloudflare Workers relay provider (best fit for AI API proxy — zero cold start, native outbound TCP, cheapest at scale)
- Deno Deploy relay provider
- Documentation translations

> **Note on Vercel:** Not recommended for relay use case — 30x costlier than Cloudflare Workers at volume, higher cold starts, no native outbound TCP on Edge runtime.

Before contributing, please test your changes end-to-end.
